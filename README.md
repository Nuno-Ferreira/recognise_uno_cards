# Recognising UNO cards

This program will be used to recognise UNO cards using Computer Vision, Machine Learning written in Python.

It will contain 2 files, one to recognise UNO cards through a file and another one to recognise them through a video feed and it will output the number and color of the card.


## Requirements
Libraries required:
Numpy;
Pickle;
Pandas;
SKLearn
KNeighborsClassifier;
MLPClassifier.


## Instructions
To identify the UNO card images run the **main.py** file and then insert the desired card with this format: b4 for the card Blue 4.

To use the camera identification run the **camera_main.py** file and present the card with a neutral background, for example, a blank piece of paper.
